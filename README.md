# FashionGAN: Generative Adversarial Network for Fashion Image Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new fashion images similar to those in the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist). The system uses TensorFlow and Keras to train a generator and a discriminator network, allowing the generation of realistic fashion images.

## Overview

This project serves as a test to explore how GANs work, using the Fashion MNIST dataset as a starting point. The architecture includes a generator and discriminator model that compete against each other, where:

- **Generator**: Creates new fashion images from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: Classifies images as either real (from the Fashion MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

## Key Features:

- Uses TensorFlow Datasets API to load and preprocess Fashion MNIST.
- A simple generator model with transposed convolutions for image generation.
- A discriminator model trained to classify real vs fake images.
- Implements a custom training loop to train the GAN, with losses plotted over time.

## Future Improvements:

- **Upsampling/Upscaling**: I plan to enhance the image quality by refining the upsampling process in the generator to create more realistic and higher-resolution images.
- **Image Generation with Prompt**: In the future, I aim to extend the model to generate images based on textual prompts, combining GAN techniques with natural language input.

The model is trained using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of clothing items categorized into 10 classes (T-shirts, trousers, bags, etc.). The generator tries to produce realistic images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated images.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FashionGAN.git
    cd FashionGAN
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` includes the following libraries:
    - TensorFlow
    - Keras
    - TensorFlow Datasets (tfds)
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib

3. Optionally, set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

## Usage

To run the training or evaluation scripts, ensure you have downloaded the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's datasets API.
